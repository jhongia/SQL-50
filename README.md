# SQL Top 50 — Interview Preparation & Query Practice

This repository documents my progress working through the **LeetCode SQL Top 50 Study Plan** as part of strengthening my data querying skills and technical interview preparation.

Rather than just solving problems, my focus is on writing clean, readable SQL and understanding *why* each solution works — including joins, aggregations, window functions, and data transformation patterns commonly used in real-world applications.
